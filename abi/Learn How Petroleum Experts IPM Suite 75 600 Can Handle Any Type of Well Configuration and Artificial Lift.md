Petroleum Experts IPM Suite 75 600 is the latest version of the Integrated Production Modelling software developed by Petroleum Experts (Petex), a leading company in the field of oil and gas software solutions. IPM Suite 75 600 is a comprehensive and powerful software package that can help you design, manage and optimize your entire production system, from reservoir to market. IPM Suite 75 600 consists of eight modules that can be run together seamlessly:
  
- GAP: A multiphase network modelling and optimization tool that can simulate and optimize the performance of the surface gathering system, including pipelines, compressors, separators, valves and pumps.
- GAP TRANSIENT: A transient well, flow-line and network modelling tool that can simulate the dynamic behavior of the production system under various operational scenarios, such as start-up, shut-down, ramp-up and emergency situations.
- PROSPER: A multiphase well and pipeline nodal analysis tool that can model and optimize the performance of individual wells or groups of wells, including artificial lift systems, such as gas lift, ESPs, PCPs and jet pumps.
- MBAL: An analytical reservoir engineering toolkit that can perform material balance analysis, PVT analysis, aquifer modelling and history matching for different types of reservoirs.
- PVTP: A thermodynamics fluid characterization package that can generate PVT data for different types of fluids, such as black oil, compositional, gas condensate and dry gas.
- REVEAL: A simulator for specialized reservoir studies that can model complex phenomena, such as near-wellbore effects, hydraulic fracturing, acid stimulation, sand production and scale deposition.
- MOVE: A structural modelling and analysis toolkit that can help you create realistic geological models and perform structural restoration, geomechanical analysis and fracture modelling.
- RESOLVE: An advanced integration platform that can connect IPM Suite 75 600 with third party software applications and data sources, such as reservoir simulators (e.g. Eclipse, CMG), process simulators (e.g. Hysys), databases (e.g. Oracle) and spreadsheets (e.g. Excel).

With IPM Suite 75 600, you can build a complete digital representation of your production system that can help you understand its behavior under different conditions and constraints. You can also perform various types of analyses and optimizations to improve your production performance and efficiency. For example, you can:
